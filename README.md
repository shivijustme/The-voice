### ([Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) + [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) + [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) + [Recorderjs](https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs))

1) Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.
2) SpeechRecognition Library for performing speech recognition, with support for several engines and APIs, online and offline.
3) Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
4) Recorderjs A plugin for recording/exporting the output of Web Audio API nodes

## Novelty 

- A wide number of industries are utilizing different applications of speech technology today, helping businesses and consumers save time and even lives.<br>
- In many circumstances customers do not actually need or want to speak to a live operator. For example, if they have little time or they only require basic information then speech recognition can be used to cut waiting times and provide customers with the information they want.<br>
- In terms of the disabled population specifically, speech recognition systems are an extremely useful tool that will only become more valuable as time progresses.<br>
